A simple markdown file where I test using [hyperlinks](/assets/cv/wiemann_CV_2021_11_06.pdf) and other nice features such as displaying pictures:

<img src="/assets/images/uchicago-logo.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

Lists are also pretty nice, as is bold and italic text:

- **bold**
- _italic_

Displaying code is a nice feature:
```python
# Whether in python
import torch
1 + 1
```

```r
# or R
library(ddml)
x <- 1
```

```julia
# or julia
use Pkg
Pkg.add(MyMethods)
```

Last but not least, there should be some nice options for displaying math in-text -- like $\beta$ -- as well as via proper equations:
\begin{equation}
\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
\end{equation}

$$\beta$$

#### Neat!
