# Welcome!

### I'm Thomas Wiemann, an Economics PhD student at the University of Chicago.

My primary research interests focus on the development of semiparametric estimation procedures that map to plausible assumptions in common economic applications. Recent projects concentrate in particular on contexts with high dimensional categorical variables for which (na√Øve) applications of conventional estimators such as Lasso or random forests appear ill-suited.
