My primary research interests lie in econometrics. Recent projects focus on inference with many categorical variables, the zero-market-share problem in discrete choice demand estimation, and identification of causal effects of macroeconomic variables on microeconomic outcomes. See [Research](\research) for details & drafts.

I also greatly enjoy working on computational projects. My co-authors and I recently released the first package for [double/debiased machine learning in Stata](https://statalasso.github.io/docs/ddml/). Other in-progress work I contribute to inlcude a package for [double/debiased machine learning in R](https://thomaswiemann.com/ddml/), and the python library [scriptflow](https://github.com/tlamadon/scriptflow/tree/dev-hpc2) for asynchronously scheduling scripts on computing clusters. See [Computing](/computing) for details.

One highlight of my PhD was to design and lecture an undergraduate course in econometrics. The course focused on the three distinct tasks arising in the analysis of causal questions (see Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007): Definition, identification, and estimation of causal parameters. See [Teaching](/teaching) for the course materials.

Don't hestitate to reach out if any our interests overlap: I'm sure we'll find something exciting to chat about! See [CV](/assets/pdfs/wiemann_cv_2023_06_23.pdf) for my contact details.
